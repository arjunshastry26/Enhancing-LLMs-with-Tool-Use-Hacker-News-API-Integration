Overview

This repository showcases how to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external tools, specifically the Hacker News API. The integration enables LLMs to fetch real-time data, improving their ability to provide accurate and current information

Workflow

User Query:

The user submits a query related to Hacker News.

API Call:

The system fetches data from the Hacker News API based on the query.

Data Processing:

The retrieved data is formatted and passed to the LLM as context.

Response Generation:

The LLM generates a response using both the API data and its built-in knowledge.

Final Output:

The enriched response is returned to the user.
